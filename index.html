      <h3>Fine-Dining Reservation Times</h3>
      <p><i>July 2025</i><br>This project focuses on analyzing and discussing options to optimize dining time and 
        sales in a fine-dining setting I worked in, where quality of service and wait times 
        are crucial for success. The project was ultimately successful in providing evidence to
        support a need for a more optimized schedule.

    <h4>Problem</h4>
    <p>
      As the ma√Ætre d' in a fine dining restaurant, the biggest difficulty is informing guests that
      their table is not yet ready. I've picked up over time what contributes to longer serivce times,
      and one of the biggest factors is who's serving the table. While I had ideas of who was, on average,
      taking the most time, I needed the data to back it up. With my administrative role in the restaurant,
      I knew we had the information available and worked with my managers to gather it together.
      <br><br>
      With this data, I would be able to discuss with my managers how to optimize scheduling and dinner
      timing.
    </p>

    <h4>Solution</h4>
    <p>
      We gathered data from Toast (our POS) and OpenTable (our reservation service) ranging from
      January 2nd, 2025, to June 30th, 2025. All of the data was aggregated and cleaned in Python
      using Pandas, while the dashboard was created using Power BI.
      <br><br>
      Rather than the focus for this project being a breakdown of sales, I was focused 
      on the data from OpenTable regarding dining time, while relating that information to sales.
      <br><br>
      The data revealed, clearly, that there were major differences in who was turning tables the quickest,
      and staying within the 1 hour and 45 minute reservation time we offer for guests. It also revealed
      who was bringing in the most sales, what proportion of reservations were within the time limit,
      and what duration of time is most efficient for revenue. 
    </p>

    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
    <p>
    Restaurant ownership has the final say on any major changes, but the dashboard was sufficient to 
    convince my managers of my suspicions, and have since changed the usual server line-up for
    the busier weekend shifts.
    <br><br>
    In agreement with my employers to publish this report, the numbers on revenue have been slightly 
    altered.
